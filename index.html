                    <p>
                        My experience with VScode so far has been a mostly positive one due to the learning process not
                        being too bad. Since the hardest part for me was at the beginning when I didn't know much about
                        the basic elements and attributes, but after I learned the basics of HTML the learning process
                        became a whole lot easier. This also led to my overall enjoyment of VScode being higher since
                        then the hard part of VScode became trying to figure out how to get everything to look like how
                        I wanted it to look like.

                    <P>My experience with RPG Maker MZ has been very positive. The reason it's so positive is due to how
                        easy and simple RPG Maker is to use, this lead to my experience being positive since it allowed me to
                        focus on my creativity instead of focusing on how to get something to happen or work. I also hope you
                        enjoy playing my game since I put a lot of work effort into. Especially on all the dialogue
                        since I had to make sure to account for the different order players could do things.
                    </P> <img style="width:150px height=150px;" src="images/RPGMAKERMZ.jfif">
